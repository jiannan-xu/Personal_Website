I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Operations Management at Robert H. Smith School of Business, the University of Maryland. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Financial Management and Mathematical Statistics from Xiamen University and a Master’s degree in Applied Statistics from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.

My research interests include marketplace analytics, service operations, and subscription business model. Methodologically, I apply bandit algorithms, conduct causal inference analyses, and combine applied machine learning methods.
